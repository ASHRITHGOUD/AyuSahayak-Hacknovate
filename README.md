**🚨 Problem Statement**
* Practicing medicine without an MBBS degree and proper registration is illegal in Telangana. The Telangana State Medical Council (TSMC) has filed multiple FIRs against RMP “quacks” and continues statewide raids.
* Still, thousands of villagers rely on these unqualified practitioners every day due to caste familiarity, lack of access to hospitals, distance, 24×7 availability, and local influence. This leads to misdiagnoses, unsafe treatments, complications, and even deaths.
* As a result, nearby city hospitals lose patients and revenue because villagers trust RMPs more than formal healthcare.

**💡 Proposed Solution**
To address this real and urgent problem, we asked:
How to reduce RMP dependency by providing a platform.
How can we bring hospital-level, trusted care to every village — safely, quickly, and affordably?

It's 
AYUSAHAYAK
An AI-powered, multi-module, trust-centric Rural Healthcare Platform that enables a legal, scalable Nurse–Doctor Assisted Telemedicine Model.

**🏥 AYUSAHAYAK Model**
Nearby city hospitals launch their own branded village clinics.
Each clinic is run on-site by a micro-trained nurse, while a hospital doctor supervises remotely.

* What happens in the clinic:
Low & medium complexity cases → Treated in the village clinic under remote supervision
High complexity cases → Escalated to the hospital immediately
Platform provides:
Secure remote doctor supervision
* Real-time video
* AI-guided workflows
* 4–6 minute diagnosis-to-treatment process
The nurse acts as the doctor’s hands, eyes, and ears, performing clinical measurements and executing treatment safely.

**❌ Why Traditional Telemedicine Fails in Rural India?**
Doctor-to-patient telemedicine doesn’t work well in villages because:
Doctors cannot measure BP, SpO₂, pulse, temperature remotely
Villagers don’t have medical equipment
Telemedicine guidelines prohibit doctors from prescribing injectables, IV drips, or performing procedures directly over video
Direct telemedicine is not enough for rural India.

✅ How AYUSAHAYAK Fills the Gap
AYUSAHAYAK builds a Trust Triangle among:
* Remote Hospital Doctor
* Village Clinic Nurse
* Patient
This model is completely legal and aligns with Telemedicine Guidelines, since the nurse is the on-ground clinical operator.
**🌟 What Makes AYUSAHAYAK Unique?**

1\. Rural Care AI Module
AYUSAHAYAK uses LLM-based reasoning to route cases:
Simple cases → PCP Agent (Primary Care Physician LLM)
Complex cases → MDT Agent (Multi-Disciplinary Team LLM)
Example:
If a patient has acidity + breathing difficulty, the MDT Agent simulates inputs from cardiology, pulmonology, and gastroenterology LLM-specialists.
A consolidated opinion is generated and passed to the doctor → reducing doctor time while increasing safety.

**2. Skin \& Wound Care AI Module**
Uses a multimodal AI pipeline combining:
CNN models
Gemini LLM
RAG retrieval system
Supports:
Wound detection
Skin problem classification
Severity scoring
Treatment guidance

3\. Guardrail Safety Framework
The system includes medical safety guardrails that:
* Prevent hallucinated advice
* Block unsafe/non-medical outputs
* Enforce guideline-safe decisions
* Maintain strict clinical boundaries

🧩 Architecture Overview
Workflow in brief:
Patient → Nurse Assessment → AI Routing → PCP/MDT Agent → Doctor Review → Treatment Plan → Nurse Executes → Follow-up
**🛠 Tech Stack**
* MERN stack for responsive full-stack web application.
* CNN model for image analysis; AI for medical reasoning. 
* Multi-agent AI with safe, explainable outputs (Guardrail Framework).
* RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) for clinical guidelines(risk factors, medications, diagnosis, causes) to improve accuracy.)
* Razorpay for payment integration
* Cloudinary for efficient image storage.
* Twilio for SMS of payment info to patient
* Gmail APIs for prescription details , payment info and all details of the consultation and hospital with doctor’s digital signature
